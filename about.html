            <section class="gum-border-frame">
                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Our Story</h2>

                <p>The Bush Chapel was born from a simple conviction: that worship should speak to where we are. For too long, Christians in Australia have sung of snow at Christmas and celebrated Easter with spring imagery. Meanwhile, we gather in the heat of summer and experience Holy Week as the leaves begin to fall.</p>

                <p>This isn't just about changing the weather references—though we do that too. It's about creating space for Australian Christians to worship in a way that feels authentic to our experience of this ancient land, with its vast ochre landscapes, its towering gum trees, its sacred silences, and its communities that know the meaning of distance and the value of connection.</p>

                <h3>What is Liturgy?</h3>
                <p>The word "liturgy" comes from the Greek <em>leitourgia</em>, meaning "the work of the people." Liturgy isn't something done <em>to</em> us—it's something we do <em>together</em>. It's the ancient practice of worshipping through set prayers, readings, and responses that connect us to Christians across the centuries and around the world.</p>

                <p>But liturgy isn't meant to be stale or lifeless. At its best, liturgy gives us words when we have none, holds us when we're falling apart, and draws us deeper into the mystery of God's love. These liturgies aim to do exactly that—while speaking in a voice that feels like home.</p>

                <h3>How to Use These Liturgies</h3>
                <p>These liturgies are designed for flexibility. You might use them:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>In personal devotion, reading all parts yourself as a prayer</li>
                    <li>With family around the dinner table or before bed</li>
                    <li>In small groups or house churches</li>
                    <li>As a framework for larger gathered worship</li>
                    <li>Alongside the video content on YouTube, praying along</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Feel free to adapt these liturgies for your context. Add your own prayers. Change words that don't fit. Make them your own. The Spirit is creative, and so should our worship be.</p>

                <h3>Following the Church Calendar</h3>
                <p>The Christian liturgical calendar has shaped the worship of believers for nearly two millennia. It invites us to journey through the life of Christ each year—waiting in Advent, celebrating at Christmas, walking through Lent, mourning on Good Friday, rejoicing at Easter, and receiving the Spirit at Pentecost.</p>

                <p>Rather than letting the commercial calendar dictate our lives, the church calendar offers an alternative rhythm—one shaped by the story of salvation rather than the story of consumption. These liturgies follow that ancient pattern, adapted for the southern hemisphere where seasons are reversed.</p>

                    <em>Welcome, friend. I'm so glad you've found your way to the Chapel.</em>
                </p>
                <p>These liturgies are written with love for the church and a deep desire to see Australian Christians worship in a way that honours both the ancient traditions of our faith and the unique context of this wide brown land.</p>

                <p>Each liturgy is paired with a YouTube video, because I believe worship is meant to be experienced, not just read. Join me as we pray together across the distances—whether you're in the city or the bush, alone or gathered, seeking or settled.</p>

                <p>You're welcome here.</p>

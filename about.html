            <h1>About The Bush Chapel</h1>

            <section class="gum-border-frame">
                <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Meet Our Host John</h2>

                <img src="the bush chapel graphics/john-photo.jpeg" alt="John" style="float: left; width: 333px; height: auto; margin: 0 1.5rem 1rem 0;">

                <p>John landed in Australia at 21, having fallen madly in love with an Australian girl while living in London. She is now his wife, and together they live in the Yarra Valley with their two teenage children, where John works as a winemaker.</p>

                <p>Having been actively involved in local church life since he can remember, John studied Theology at school and then university. He loves being outdoors with friends and also plays soccer in a local league for fun.</p>

                <h3>The Journey to Wine</h3>
                <p>John knew little about wine in England, but when he moved to Australia, he lived and worked at an orchard while finishing his Honours thesis. As he finished, he realised he loved agriculture, and moved from orchards to viticulture, which opened his eyes to wine. Fast forward a few years and he now works as a winemaker.</p>

                <h3>Why Liturgy?</h3>
                <p>John's favourite church memories always revolve around times when traditional liturgical life meets creative and fresh expressions. He finds deep and ancient truths resonate in these moments, becoming part of his spiritual life as he joins in on the great story of the Gospel.</p>

                <h3>How Faith Shapes the Week</h3>
                <p>John's faith is like the coordinates that ground a confidence and a hope. His relationship with Jesus has centred him on love and joy and being wide-eyed. It has led to wonderful friendships and to faith heroes to admire. Years with the Bible has given him a world he finds endlessly intriguing.</p>

                <p>It is the foundation he lives each week from as much as anything else. Eugene Peterson titled a book 'Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places' — John likes that idea, and his hope is that Christ is playing in ten thousand places, in one way or another, in his daily life.</p>

                <h3>A Perfect Saturday</h3>
                <p>Going mountain bike riding with his son, followed by sitting outside around a fire with old friends and good wine, laughing and watching the kids larking about.</p>
